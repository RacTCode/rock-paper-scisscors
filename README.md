# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple game that I had made to learn handling event listeners in JavaScript.
This project idea was from Odin Project

## Content
- Allows the user to play a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors with the computer
- It has a simple GUI
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options
- The player's choice is compared with the computer's choice and points are given to the winner
- The game continues until someone gets 5 points

## Why did I make it?
I made it to learn about event listeners and how I could change the DOM model

*PS: No, I did not make it interactive. If you feel it is, it's because I use flexbox for centering my divs. I found using media queries for a practice project to be overkill*
